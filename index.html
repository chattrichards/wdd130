            <p>The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is a federal territory in central Nigeria.
                Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, is located in this territory. The FCT was formed
                in 1976[4] from
                parts of the states of old Kaduna, Kwara, Niger, and Plateau states, with the bulk
                of land mass
                carved out of Niger state. The Federal Capital Territory is within the North Central
                region of the
                country. Unlike other states of Nigeria, which are headed by elected Governors, it
                is administered
                by the Federal Capital Territory Administration, headed by a minister, who is
                appointed by the president. </p>
